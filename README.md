## Project Overview

The **Stack Write** backend provides a fully functional API for a blogging platform, enabling users to perform CRUD operations on their blogs. It also includes role-based permissions for **Admins** and **Users**, secure JWT-based authentication, and a powerful public API for reading blogs with advanced search, filter, and sort functionalities.

---

## Features

### User Roles

- **Admin**
  - Manually created
  - Can block users and delete any blog
- **User**
  - Can register, log in
  - Can create, update, delete their own blogs

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure routes with middleware

### Blog Management

- CRUD operations for blogs (by authors only)
- Public blog listing with search, filter, and sort

### Admin Functionalities

- Block any user
- Delete any blog

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Runtime:** Node.js
- **Framework:** Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose
- **Authentication:** JSON Web Token (JWT)
- **Validation:** Zod
- **Security:** Bcrypt

---

## API Endpoints

Please refer to the full API documentation [here](#) or check below for highlights:

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/register` ‚Äî Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` ‚Äî Login and receive access token
- `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` ‚Äî Generates the new access token after being expired

### Blogs

- `POST /api/blogs` ‚Äî Create blog (Auth Required)
- `PATCH /api/blogs/:id` ‚Äî Update blog (Author Only)
- `DELETE /api/blogs/:id` ‚Äî Delete blog (Author Only)
- `GET /api/blogs` ‚Äî Public endpoint with `search`, `sortBy`, `sortOrder`, and `filter` query support

### Admin Actions

- `PATCH /api/admin/users/:userId/block` ‚Äî Block user
- `DELETE /api/admin/blogs/:id` ‚Äî Delete any blog

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The following diagram illustrates the database structure, including entities like `User`, `Role`, and `Blog`, along with their relationships.

## Installation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nadim-Nion/stack-write.git
cd stack-write
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Create .env File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project and copy the environment variables from below:

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Server

### üìå Development Mode (with Auto-Reload)

To run the project in development mode with automatic reloading on code changes:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This uses `ts-node-dev` under the hood, which watches your TypeScript files and restarts the server automatically on changes.

### üìå Required Dev Dependency

Make sure you have `ts-node-dev` installed:

```bash
npm install --save-dev ts-node-dev
```

Your `package.json` should include:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start:dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only ./src/server.ts"
}
```

### üìå Production Build and Start

1. Build the production-ready files:

```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
npm run start:prod
```

This will execute the compiled code from the `dist/` directory.

Your `package.json` should include:

```json
"scripts": {
 "start:prod": "node ./dist/server.js",
  "start:dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only ./src/server.ts",
  "build": "tsc",
}
```

---

## Environment Variables

Make sure to include the following in your `.env` file:

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=<your-environment> # e.g., development, production
PORT=<your-port-number>
DATABASE_URL=<your-mongodb-uri>

BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=<your-salt-rounds> # e.g., 10, 12, 14

JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<your-access-secret>
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=<your-access-token-expiry> # e.g., 1d, 2h, 30m

JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<your-refresh-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=<your-refresh-token-expiry> # e.g., 365d, 30d, 7d
```

### üìå Generating a Secure JWT Access Secret

To set up a secure JWT access secret, you'll need a strong 64-byte (512-bit) secret key.

### üìå Generate a 64-byte Secret in Node.js

Run the following command in your node terminal. Run command `node` to enter the Node.js REPL, then paste the command below to generate a secure random string:

```bash
require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex')
```

This will output a long hexadecimal string. Example output:

```bash
e9b5f19e27a2a9e6a40d74b2dabc6d6f3a3b99ea8c4d10f5ff1c47c6a83d0b7f...
```

### üìå Set the Generated Secret in Your .env File

Copy the generated string and set it in your `.env` file:

```plaintext
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
```

### üìå Example .env file (sample)

```plaintext
NODE_ENV=<your-environment> # e.g., development, production
PORT=<your-port-number>
DATABASE_URL=<your-mongodb-uri>

BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS=<your-salt-rounds> # e.g., 10, 12, 14

JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<your-access-secret>
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES_IN=<your-access-token-expiry> # e.g., 1d, 2h, 30m

JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=<your-refresh-secret>
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=<your-refresh-token-expiry> # e.g., 365d, 30d, 7d
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints follow a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Error message",
  "statusCode": 400,
  "error": { "details": "Validation or other error info" },
  "stack": "Error stack trace (only in development)"
}
```

### üìå Common Error Types

- ZOD_ERROR: Schema validation failed

- NOT_FOUND_ERROR: Resource not found

- VALIDATION_ERROR: Input issue

- AUTH_ERROR: Invalid credentials

- AUTHORIZATION_ERROR: No permission

- INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR: General backend failure
